* Emacs Keymap
Lisp data structure that specifies key bindings for various key sequences.
** Key Sequence
*** Input Event
- characters
- function keys
- mouse actions
- system events
*** Prefix Key
Key sequence bind to a keymap.
- Standard prefix keys
  like C-x, C-c, etc.
- Custom prefix keys
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (define-prefix-command 'example-prefix-map)
#+end_src
*** Complete Key
Key sequence bind to a command.
** Keymap
- minor-mode Keymap
  Defined in minor mode will shadow local and global keymaps.
  (Which key binding will be choosed between same minor-mode bindings?)
- Local (major-mode) Keymap
  Defined in current buffer's major mode, shadows global keymap.
- Global Keymap
  Keymaps that shared between all buffers.
