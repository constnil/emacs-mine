#+TITLE: emacs-mine - An emacs study kit
#+STARTUP: content
#+OPTIONS: toc:4 h:4

* Preface
/(This was originally my emacs configuration backup repository)/

There are hundreds of emacs config repositories on github (prelude, emacs-live,
spacemacs, etc). I started by including them individualy as submodule (so called
"config suit") and load particular suit specified by environment variable
$EMACS_CONFIG on emacs startup. Thus I can easily taste and study them, not mess
up my own configuration.

* Suit management will not use submodule
- How to define suit? (name, repos location, ...)
- Maybe not use environment variable too?
- Which famous suits too include by default?
* Use cask and ecukes for study purpose?
* Functions for emacs study?
- Insert command name by key press
* Change "mine" suit to "kess - Keep Emacs Simple, Stupid" suit
- [X] make kess as default
- [X] C-` prefix key map, mainly for mark related commands
- [ ] C-backspace backward-delete-line
- [ ] M-backspace backward-delete-word
