* emacs-mine - An Emacs Study Kit
This was my emacs config backup git repository.

There are hundreds of emacs config repositories on github (prelude, emacs-live,
spacemacs, etc). I started my own by submodule them as "config suit" individualy
and start emacs respect $EMACS_CONFIG environment variable.

** TODO More text to describe works

** Suit management will not use submodule
- How to define suit? (name, repos location, ...)
- Maybe not use environment variable too?
- Which famous suits too include by default?
** Use cask and ecukes for study purpose?
** Functions for emacs study?
- Insert command name by key press
** Change "mine" suit to "kess - Keep Emacs Simple, Stupid" suit
- [X] make kess as default
- [X] C-` prefix key map, mainly for marker related commands
- [ ] C-backspace backward-delete-line
- [ ] M-backspace backward-delete-word
